    			<p>Biological networks such as protein-protein interaction, transcription regulatory, 
    			gene regulatory, and metabolic networks  are often referred to as complex systems. 
    			The term complex relates to the existence of non-trivial substructures contained 
    			within them. The study of complex systems involves the analysis of the way in which 
    			their elements interact rather than only their individual roles. Computationally, 
    			such a study entails the ability to query networks to find specific patterns of interactions.
				</p>
				<p>Possible queries might include the identification of positive and negative autoregulation, 
				coherent and incoherent feed forward loops, single-input modules and dense overlapping 
				regulons in a given target network <i>N</i>. Sub-networks that occur surprisingly often 
				in a network may be preferred by evolution. For that reason, NetMatch* offers the 
				ability to compute a p-value against seven random null models and suggests the one 
				that shares the network properties of <i>N</i> in terms of degree distribution, cluster 
				coefficient and assortativity.</p>

				<p align="left">NetMatch* works on Cytoscape (3.2.1) and is based on 
				the NetMatch software. It deals with both exact queries and approximate ones, in which wildcards 
				are used to match unspecified number of elements.</p>
				<p>NetMatch* integrates the RI algorithm proposed for biological real networks which outperforms 
				other existing algorithms, whose efficiency is mainly due to the choice of a search strategy, 
				i.e. the ordering with which query nodes are mapped. For example, a variable ordering may 
				begin with a query node having the highest degree or having the most uncommon label in the 
				target graph. The variable ordering of RI is based only on the query graph topology. Roughly, 
				the chosen order creates constraints as early as possible in the matching phase. The nodes 
				having high valence and that are highly connected with nodes previously present in the ordering 
				tend to come early in the variable-ordering. The aim of RI is to avoid costly pruning techniques 
				by finding a static search strategy such that the number of constraints that are verifiable from 
				a partial solution are maximized.</p>
				<p>NetMatch* also supports approximate querying. Approximate queries are graphs with unspecified 
				structures. They may contain nodes and edges which can match any value of node or edge labels in 
				the network and approximate paths constrained in length to be less than or greater than <i>m</i>, 
				where <i>m</i> is a positive integer. NetMatch* first matches all the specified subparts of the 
				queries exactly and then joins the matches by network traversal. The network traversal phase 
				checks that all traversed paths satisfy the query path constraints.</p>
